# Personal Bio Page Creation

## Objective
Design a personal bio page that incorporates text content, images, and hyperlinks. This project allows you to present yourself professionally online and practice essential web design elements.

## Requirements
- **Profile Section**: Include a main header (`<h1>`) with your name and a subheader (`<h2>`) with your professional title or area of study.
- **Biography**: Write a brief biography in a few paragraphs (`<p>`), covering your background, interests, and any professional or academic achievements.
- **Images**: Insert at least one image that represents you or your interests. This could be a profile picture, a favorite hobby, or an important event.
- **Links**:
  - Include at least two absolute hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) leading to external websites, such as your professional social media profile (like LinkedIn) and an external site that you find inspiring.
  - Add one relative hyperlink pointing to another HTML document within your project repository, such as a page detailing a specific project or achievement.

## Optional CSS
Feel free to use CSS to enhance the layout, styling, and responsiveness of your bio page. Using CSS is optional and should be included in a separate CSS file linked to your HTML document.

## Guidelines
- Use proper HTML5 document structure, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Ensure all images have appropriate `alt` attributes for accessibility.
- Make sure your HTML code is well-organized, commented where appropriate, and validates against HTML5 standards.
- Test your webpage in various web browsers to ensure it displays correctly.

## Submission
Submit your HTML file by pushing it to your designated GitHub repository. Ensure the file is named `index.html`. If you use CSS, make sure to also submit the linked CSS file.

## Evaluation
Your personal bio page will be evaluated on:
- Correct implementation and use of HTML tags, especially headers, paragraphs, images, and links.
- The clarity and relevance of the content, particularly how well it introduces and represents you.
- Correct use of absolute and relative links.
- Overall organization and readability of your HTML code.
- If used, the implementation of CSS and its effectiveness in enhancing the webpage's visual appeal and usability.

Enjoy creating your personal bio page and showcasing your web design skills!
